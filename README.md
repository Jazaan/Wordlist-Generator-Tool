#Overview
The Bash Wordlist Generator is a versatile and customizable tool for generating wordlists that can be used for various purposes, including password cracking, security testing, and more. This Bash script allows you to define the character set, word length range, output file, and provides the option for verbose mode to monitor word generation progress.

#Features
Custom Character Set: Specify the characters to include in the wordlist. You can use the default character set (a-z0-9) or define your own.

Variable Word Length: Set the minimum and maximum word length to generate wordlists with a range of word lengths.

Custom Output File: Choose the name and location of the output file where the generated wordlist will be saved.

Verbose Mode: Enable verbose mode to display the progress of word generation, making it easier to track the process.
